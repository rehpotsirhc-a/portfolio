                <p>I am a Junior in Highschool trying to figure out what to do with myself before my best years run out.
                    Some of my Achievements include Founding the Edison High School Badminton Club, playing Varsity Golf
                    for 5 years, and maintaining straight A's for all of sophomore year. Some of my hobbies are playing
                    golf, gardening, playing/programming video games, cycling, reading absurdist philosophy novels, and
                    exploring science. If nothing goes well for me (which is a common occurance) I plan on working at McDonalds
                     until I get promoted to manager and living out the rest of my days on that sweet $60k a
                    year. However, my main goal is to get a respectable job like an electrician or a pilot or really any
                    well-paying job because I have no preference nor passion to drive me to favor one position over another, bag a bop, and live happily ever after. The
                    path I'm on currently sets me up for computer programming or web design gigs but every body wants those
                    jobs, and everyone knows AI is coming for them, so that market is pretty bleak.</p>
