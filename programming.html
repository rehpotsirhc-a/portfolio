                <p>Play a choose-your-own adventure game I made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
                <p>MogQuest was the culmination of all three languages I've learned throughout the year. Creating an adventure game with multiple mechanics, a storyline, and various branching paths felt daunting at first. But the deadline was forgiving, and I had a partner to help split the work. The road to completion was challenging but manageable with the right time, energy, and dedication. Although some hurdles were too high to jump, I accepted them and simply found ways around them.</p>

                <a href="https://trythisonforsize.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Trion Website</a>
                <p>View the project I produced during my internship with Trion Supercars.</p>
                <p>Utilizing HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript, this was my first significant team-based project. It tested both my programming knowledge and my teamwork skills. This experience pushed my abilities further than I imagined and taught me that monumental tasks can be tackled through planning, communication, and a solid schedule.</p>

                <div class="houde">
                <a href="https://brainhome.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Smart Home</a>
                <p>Take a look at this mock real estate website for a "Smart Home".</p>
                <p>This was the first major project of my programming journey. It built the foundation of my coding style and acted as a benchmark for everything I learned during the first half of the year.</p>

                <div class="bcalc">
                <a href="https://harrowing.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Budget Calculator</a>
                <p>Plan your expenses with my budget calculator.</p>
                <p>This project was unique. Instead of building the budget calculator myself, I first had to oversee other developers and instruct them on how it should work. Then, we switched roles—I became a developer following instructions. We graded each other on our performance as both a project lead and a developer. I scored highly in both roles.</p>

                <div class="cert">
                <a href="https://bombaclot.netlify.app//" target="_blank">Certificate generator</a>
                <p>Generate a custom certificate with your own text.</p>
                <p>This was my first JavaScript-heavy project of the year. Learning JavaScript was a tough challenge, and I'm still improving. Integrating it with HTML and CSS added another layer of complexity. Most of the work was done outside of class due to the short deadline and limited in-class time, teaching me the importance of self-discipline.</p>

                <p>Try out my custom-built calculator.</p>
                <p>This project helped grow my understanding of JavaScript. Positioned between the certificate printer and the budget calculator projects, it served as a bridge—giving me the math operation experience I needed to complete the budget calculator successfully.</p>

                <p>View my submission for the CSS Zen Garden project.</p>
                <p>Zen CSS was my introduction to CSS. The project challenged me by allowing no HTML changes—only CSS. With my limited knowledge at the time, it pushed me to learn selectors and styling techniques in creative ways.</p>
