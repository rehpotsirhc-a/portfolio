            <p>I am a Junior in Highschool trying to figure out what to do with myself before my best years run out.
                Some of my Achievements include Founding the Edison High School Badminton Club. Playing Varsity Golf for
                5 years. Some of my hobbies are Playing golf, red baiting, video games, reading absurdist philosophy
                novels, and science. If nothing goes well for me (which it rarely does anyway) I plan on working at
                McDonalds until I get promoted to manager and living out the rest of my days on that sweet $60k a year.
                But my main goal is to get a respectable job like an electrician or pilot or really any well paying job
                because I have no preference nor passion to drive me to favor one position over another. The path I'm on
                currently sets me up for computer programming or web design gigs but I'll probably not ever be good
                enough to be considered for hiring and Iâ€™ll also just be replaced with ai in 5 years time.</p>
